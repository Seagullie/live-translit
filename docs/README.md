### Description
<p>Have no desire to learn several keyboard layouts? Your QWERTY WPM is quite good and you want to leverage it to the max?</p>
Then this script will be of help to you.</p>
<p>The easiest way to start is to download the <code>live_translit</code> folder in <code>live-translit/dist/</code> and run the <code>live_translit.exe</code>.<br/>
  Once booted up, the transliterator can be turned on or off by pressing <code>Alt + T </code>(it will be turned on by default).</p>
<p>
The transliterator replaces your input with Ukrainian letters. <br/>
  You can provide your own replacement table by editing <code>tables.py</code> in <code>live-translit/translit_func/translit_tables</code>.</p>
