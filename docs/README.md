### Description
<p>Have no desire to learn several keyboard layouts? Your QWERTY WPM is quite good and you want to leverage it to the max?</p>
Then this script will be of help to you.</p>
<p>The easiest way to start is to download the live_translit folder in live-translit/dist/ and run the live_translit.exe<br/>
Once booted up, the transliterator can be turned on or off by pressing Alt + T (it will be turned on by default)</p>
